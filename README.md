# Dotfiles

Dotfiles repository that contains all of my configs.

## DISCLAIMER

---

This config is designed for Linux, however it will work for MacOS with some tinkering
---

---

- Given this is primarily a Linux config, `stow` and `pray`

## Kudos

---

- @viqueen's Devbox repo, some scripts have been borrowed and added into `.zshrc`
- @macintacos for some helpful neovim keybinds, plus some various helper functions
